            <h1>Lung Cancer Prediction Model</h1>
            <p>Currently, lung cancer is a prevalent form of cancer, largely due to factors such as smoking, work-related hazards, and pollution in modern cities. This study develops a model to predict the likelihood of lung cancer in individuals by analyzing certain conditions. Using a dataset containing multiple features, the study employs the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) to identify the most important features for prediction. The model achieved a k-fold mean accuracy of over 97% with all features and more than 93% with reduced features. The model was developed with a focus on time efficiency and accuracy, ensuring robustness without overfitting, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.</p>

            <h1>Biomedical Text Classification for Cancer Research</h1>
            <p>Biomedical text classification plays a crucial role in organizing large volumes of research articles in the medical field. This study focuses on a dataset of 7,570 cancer-related research papers categorized into three classes. Using Word2Vec and BERT models, the study converts text into numeric vectors for classification. Nine machine learning classifiers were evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. The Random Forest (RF) classifier with Word2Vec embedding achieved a remarkable 99.98% mean accuracy, while BERT models also demonstrated excellent performance with around 97.70% mean accuracy. The results indicate high efficacy in multiclass text classification, ensuring optimal performance and overcoming overfitting.</p>
